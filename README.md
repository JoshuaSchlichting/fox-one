Deploy a gaming rig in the cloud using terraform.

> NOTE: This is a work in progress. The `master` branch is currently deployable, but not ready for a gaming experience.

## What's working
This project is a work in progress. Currently, RDP access to the desktop is working. However, the plan is to get [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org) installed for the gaming experience.

## How to deploy
```bash
cd terraform
terraform apply
```
